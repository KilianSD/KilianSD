# Little More About Me ðŸš€
I am a computer scientist based in MontrÃ©al, Canada. I have a focus in software exploitation, reverse-engineering, malware analysis/programming (legally) and hardware/electrical engineering.
Currently I am studying for CS161 (Operating Systems) which was offered by harvard, I was previously studying at Arizona State University for CSE466 (Computer Systems Security).

I also been programming for a very long time now, I still do it on a daily basis (projects, homework, practice) but for the interested here's a list of the main programming languages I use the most in my work (descending order, most comfortable with to less comfortable) :
  - C++
  - C
  - ASM
  - Python
  - Golang
  - Javascript
  - Rust
  - Haskell
  
I will be using this github mostly to share writeups, pdfs and documents about my ongoing studies. A few projects might also eventually get posted in here, we'll see depending on how things goes for the next few months.
